**Contents:**
- Inheritance ​

Inheritance allows to add icons for a specific folder to all the files that are only at the root of the folder. That means that that all root files in a folder will have an icon, if inheritance is applied.

After clicking the Inherit icon menu item, a icon modal will pop up where you can select the icon you want for the inheritance. After that, all the files have the icon.

If you found some weird characters in your text, it's probably because of the encoding. The reason for this issue is most likely that Emojis are turned off which just removes all the Emojis in your text.

You can enable emojis by following this guide. This should most likely resolve the issue.

Iconize and Metadatamenu work together, but you need to tweak a few options, if you want to use frontmatter and want to see recommendations when you want to insert a new icon in your markdown.

First, according to this GitHub issue you need to adjust the frontmatter field name to something else like iconizeIcon.

This will allow you to use frontmatter in your markdown files.

To see recommendations when you want to insert a new icon in your markdown, you also need to adjust the icon identifier which normally starts with : to something else than :.

This will allow you to see recommendations when you want to insert a new icon in your markdown.
